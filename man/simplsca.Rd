\title{SIMPLS-CA: SIMPLS Canonical Analysis}
\usage{
simplsca(X, Y, comps = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix or data frame with two or more columns (X-block).}

\item{Y}{Numeric matrix or data frame with two or more columns (Y-block).}

\item{comps}{Number of components to be extracted.
(\code{TRUE} by default).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{'simplsca'}, basically a list with the
following elements:

\item{x.scores}{scores of the X-block (also known as T
components)}

\item{x.wgs}{weights of the X-block}

\item{y.scores}{scores of the Y-block (also known as U
components)}

\item{y.wgs}{weights of the Y-block}

\item{cor.xt}{correlations between X and T}

\item{cor.yu}{correlations between Y and U}

\item{cor.xu}{correlations between X and U}

\item{cor.yt}{correlations between Y and T}

\item{cor.tu}{correlations between T and U}

\item{R2XT}{explained variance of X by T}

\item{R2YT}{explained variance of Y by T}

\item{R2YU}{explained variance of Y by U}

\item{R2XU}{explained variance of X by U}
}
