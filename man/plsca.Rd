\title{PLS-CA: Partial Least Squares Canonical Analysis}
\usage{
plsca(X, Y, comps = NULL, scaled = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame (X-block) with more than one variable. 
No missing data are allowed}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix or data frame (Y-block) with more than one variable. 
No missing data are allowed}

\item{comps}{The number of extracted PLS components (\code{NULL} by default)
When \code{comps=NULL} the number of components is determined by taking the
minimum between the number of columns from \code{X} and \code{Y}.}

\item{scaled}{A logical value indicating whether scaling data should be
performed (\code{TRUE} by default).
#'When \code{scaled=TRUE} the data is scaled to standardized values (mean=0,
variance=1). Otherwise the data will only be centered (mean=0).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{'plsca'}, basically a list with the
following elements:

\item{x.scores}{scores of the X-block (also known as T
components)}

\item{x.wgs}{weights of the X-block}

\item{x.loads}{loadings of the X-block}

\item{y.scores}{scores of the Y-block (also known as U
components)}

\item{y.wgs}{weights of the Y-block}

\item{y.loads}{loadings of the Y-block}

\item{cor.xt}{correlations between X and T}

\item{cor.yu}{correlations between Y and U}

\item{cor.tu}{correlations between T and U}

\item{cor.xu}{correlations between X and U}

\item{cor.yt}{correlations between Y and T}

\item{R2X}{explained variance of X by T}

\item{R2Y}{explained variance of Y by U}

\item{com.xu}{communality of X with U}

\item{com.yt}{communality of Y with T}
}
\description{
Performs partial least squares canonical analysis for two blocks of data.
Compared to PLSR2, the blocks of variables in PLS-CA play a symmetric role
(i.e. there is neither predictors nor responses)

 # apply plsca
 my_plsca = plsca(vehicles[,1:12], vehicles[,13:16])
