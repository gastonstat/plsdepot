\title{PLS-R2: Partial Least Squares Regression 2}
\usage{
plsreg2(predictors, responses, comps = 2, crosval = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictors}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing the predictor variables.}

\item{responses}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing the response variables.}

\item{comps}{The number of extracted PLS components (2 by default)}

\item{crosval}{Logical indicating whether cross-validation should be performed
(\code{TRUE} by default). No cross-validation is done if there is missing data or
if there are less than 10 observations.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{'plsreg2'}, basically a list with the
following elements:

\item{x.scores}{components of the predictor variables (also known as T-components)}

\item{x.loads}{loadings of the predictor variables}

\item{y.scores}{components of the response variables (also known as U-components)}

\item{y.loads}{loadings of the response variables}

\item{cor.xt}{correlations between X and T}

\item{cor.yt}{correlations between Y and T}

\item{cor.xu}{correlations between X and U}

\item{cor.yu}{correlations between Y and U}

\item{cor.tu}{correlations between T and U}

\item{raw.wgs}{weights to calculate the PLS scores with the deflated
matrices of predictor variables}

\item{mod.wgs}{modified weights to calculate the PLS scores with the
matrix of predictor variables}

\item{std.coefs}{Vector of standardized regression coefficients (used with 
scaled data)}

\item{reg.coefs}{Vector of regression coefficients (used with the original
data)}

\item{y.pred}{Vector of predicted values}

\item{resid}{Vector of residuals}

\item{expvar}{table with R-squared coefficients}

\item{VIP}{Variable Importance for Projection}

\item{Q2}{table of Q2 indexes (i.e. leave-one-out cross validation)}

\item{Q2cum}{table of cummulated Q2 indexes}
}
\description{
The function plsreg2 performs partial least squares regression for the multivariate case (i.e.
more than one response variable)
}
\details{
The minimum number of PLS components \code{comps} to be extracted is 2.

The data is scaled to standardized values (mean=0, variance=1).

The argument \code{crosval} gives the option to perform cross-validation.
This parameter takes into account how \code{comps} is specified.
When \code{comps=NULL}, the number of components is obtained by cross-validation.
When a number of components is specified, cross-validation results are calculated
for each component.

\examples{

 \dontrun{
 ## example of PLSR2 with the vehicles dataset
 data(vehicles)
 
 # apply plsreg2 extracting 2 components (no cross-validation)
 pls2_one = plsreg2(vehicles[,1:12], vehicles[,13:16], comps=2, crosval=FALSE)
 
 # apply plsreg2 with selection of components by cross-validation
 pls2_two = plsreg2(vehicles[,1:12], vehicles[,13:16], comps=NULL, crosval=TRUE)
 
 # apply plsreg2 extracting 5 components with cross-validation
 pls2_three = plsreg2(vehicles[,1:12], vehicles[,13:16], comps=5, crosval=TRUE)
 
 # plot variables
 plot(pls2_one)
